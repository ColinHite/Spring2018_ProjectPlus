Junior project:

You have to get the Nav Mesh working in the places you want to be able to teleport to. 
You also have to get the joints to work for your main menu character select. 
Also you have to get the UI elements reworking and the persistant select character script.

Frontend working in VR game

Character Design:

Do your own thing. This can be things like making tools for maya or doing character design.

Some ideas for maya tools include a renaming script that can find and replace text. 
A tool that sews geometry together along an edge. 
A tool that seperates and detatches geometry
A tool that does all the rigging in the same script.
  - An update to the scripts that you have finished would be things like changing the joint size and the control size and orientation.
  - Also making a script that can step through things so that you can give them custom controls would be great. 
A tool that can double or half frames in the timeline ie if the frame is on 1 and 2 then it would be on frames 1 and 3 or something similar. 

Otherwise you could do sillyetts :p
Also you can redesign your witch character! Oh and color it with your pens and things.

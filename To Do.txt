Character Design:

Do your own thing. This can be things like making tools for maya or doing character design.

Some ideas for maya tools include a renaming script that can find and replace text. 
A tool that sews geometry together along an edge. 
A tool that seperates and detatches geometry
A tool that does all the rigging in the same script.
  - An update to the scripts that you have finished would be things like changing the joint size and the control size and orientation.
  - Also making a script that can step through things so that you can give them custom controls would be great. 
A tool that can double or half frames in the timeline ie if the frame is on 1 and 2 then it would be on frames 1 and 3 or something similar. 

Otherwise you could do sillyetts :p
Also you can redesign your witch character! Oh and color it with your pens and things.
